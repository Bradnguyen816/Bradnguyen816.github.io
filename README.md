Hello! I'm Brad Nguyen and I'm a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) majoring in computer engineering that's planning to graduate in 2028.
## Favorite labs in CPSC120L

Lab 2: Part 1

I came to my first lab pretty late because I was picking up family from the airport so Lab 2, Part 1 became my first and most memorable lab. We learned how to use basic code to recreate mad libs which was fun since I grew up playing with mad libs and creating my own, especially through code was very fun. After finishing the code, I learned how to use Github. Normally Iâ€™d use Github to export mods for video games but creating my code and importing it into the site made me feel like computer science was a good choice as a career.

Lab 3: Part 1

Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it was a great introduction on how to use math in my code. This allowed me to create a function that was a calculator that calculated how many calories a man and woman are required to eat a day which is quite helpful. Making something not only for an assignment but something I can really use in my daily life was fun for me and a great introduction to coding.

Lab 7: Part 1

Lab 7, Part 1 was also one of my favorite labs because I was able to create a program that automated parking rules. Creating the code for this lab was pretty fun since I set the rules on different streets. I got to add many different inputs and outputs like what days, times of the day, and the specific hours and minutes for each street which made it feel quite close to a real scenario which was interesting for me and my partner.
